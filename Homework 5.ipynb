    "The McHenry County Water Resource Specialist is looking for new ways to view data that is being collected by the county. The USGS is currently collecting data in real-time for a number of wells in McHenry County. Your task in this assignment is to explore the real-time data in McHenry County and decide on dates to create two potentiometric surfaces, one preceding the 2021 drought (this might either be in late 2020 or early 2021) and another at the peak of the 2021 drought. <b>The wells you will be using for this assignment can be found in the Excel file 'gwmchenry_deep.xlsx'. The files contains columns that (respectively) contain USGS Site Number, Site Name, and Land Surface Elevation.</b>\n",
